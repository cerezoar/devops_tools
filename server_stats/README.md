This is a simple python script to check the basic performance statistics of a pc or server.

### How to use

1. You will need to install `uv` and `python` in your system or server.

2. Copy the code from the `server_stats.py` and paste to your python file.

3. Run the code using the command `uv run <filename>`. This will automatically download the dependencies and run the code.
